# 🎭 Prank Calculator

📝 Project Description: Prank Calculator

Prank Calculator is a fun and interactive twist on a basic calculator built with React. At its core, it performs all standard arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage. However, unlike a typical calculator, this one has a secret prank feature: it randomly gives an incorrect result, plays a sound effect, and applies a visual "glitch" to surprise the user.

The project demonstrates how basic utility apps can be enhanced with creative logic, animations, and media to engage users in unexpected ways. It's a great example of combining practical coding skills with playful UX design.
